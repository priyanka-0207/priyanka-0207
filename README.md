👋 Hi, I’m Priyanka  

I’m a Master’s student in Applied Machine Intelligence at Northeastern University who enjoys turning messy data and ideas into systems that actually work. I’m most excited by problems where machine learning, data engineering, and real-world constraints intersect.

🧠 What I focus on  
I work on applied machine learning and data engineering, with hands-on experience building end-to-end pipelines that include data ingestion, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and analysis. I care deeply about clarity in code, reproducibility in experiments, and understanding why a system behaves the way it does.

🚀 What I’m working on right now  
I’m strengthening my foundations in core ML algorithms, ML system design, and data structures while building projects that reflect production-oriented thinking rather than one-off experiments. I’m especially interested in how engineering decisions affect model performance and reliability.

🛠 Tech I work with  
Python, Java, SQL, machine learning pipelines, ETL workflows, data analysis, computer vision, and model evaluation. I enjoy learning tools deeply instead of collecting them superficially.

📂 What you’ll find here  
The repositories on this profile showcase practical projects such as intelligent waste management, route optimization, data-driven reporting, and ML-based prediction systems. Each project is structured to clearly explain the problem, approach, and technical tradeoffs.

🌱 What I value  
Clean data, explainable models, scalable systems, and thoughtful documentation. I believe good engineering is as much about decision-making as it is about code.

📫 Let’s connect  
I’m actively exploring machine learning and data engineering fulltime roles.

Thanks for stopping by and taking a look at my work.
